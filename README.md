# SYNOPSIS

A simple pastebin using [Dancer](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dancer).

To get started, first update the dsn setting in config.yml to point to a
database that your user has write access to.
Don't worry about creating the database tables.
Dancebin will do that for you the first time it runs.

Then run the app with:

    $ ./bin/app.pl

# REQUIREMENTS

Dancebin requires [pygments](http://pygments.org/docs/) to be installed
for syntax highlighting.  You can probably install this on your system with:

    $ sudo easy_install Pygments

or something similar.
